				<h2>Issachar</h2>
				<div class="verse">
					<p><i>Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens: And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.<br/><span style="float: right;"><sup>Genesis 49:14‭-‬15 KJV</sup></span></i></p>
				</div>
				
				<p>The beginning verse of the above qouted passage of scripture, Jacob was blessing his sons and as scripture put it, <i>"...telling them things that shall befall them in the future"</i>.</p>
				<p>Of Issachar he said "Issachar is a strong ass couching <b>between two burdens...</b>", the first thing I was drawn to was the adjective used to describe Issachar's position: an ass, a beast of burden, that he was found, put between two burdens. I was brought to an understanding that he found himself in a place where work was/is to be done and <b>had given</b> himself to become a tool of work (as described by the adjective used: an ass, a strong ass). This brought an understanding that, Issachar had made himself available to be a burden bearer, available for responsibility.</p>
				
				<p>Following down the scripture, a detailing of what the burdens Issachar found himself face between is defined - "<i>...he saw that <b>rest</b> was good and the <b>land that it was pleasant</b></i>"; that made him unique.</p>

				<h3>The Burdens</h3>
				<p>A closer look at the burdens demand a greater appreciation for the character of Issachar, a man with vision and understanding of the times that of the tribe of Issachar <i>(out of his lineage)</i> it is recorded that they were men who understood the times and knew what should be done. <i><b>...from Issachar, men who understood the times and knew what Israel should do</b> - 200 chiefs, with all their relatives under their command" 1 Chron. 12:32 NIV</i>; which in summary would say, Issachar was blessed/anointed as one that had understanding, could weigh the options sieving through its details to gain knowledge through understanding and wisdom to act rightly.</p>
				
				<h3>Rest</h3>
				<div class="verse">
					<p><i>Today if you you hear His voice, "Do not harden your hearts as you did at Meribah, as you did that day at Massah in the wilderness,  where your ancestors tested me; they tried me, though they had seen what I did.  For forty years I was angry with that generation; I said, ‘They are a people whose hearts go astray, and they have not known my ways.’  So I declared an oath in my anger, ‘They shall never enter my rest.<br/><span style="float: right;"><sup>Psalm 95:8‭-‬11 NIV</sup></span></i></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="verse">
					<p><i>Therefore since it still remains for some to enter that rest, and since those who formerly had the good news proclaimed to them did not go in because of their disobedience, God again set a certain day, calling it “Today.” This he did when a long time later he spoke through David, as in the passage already quoted: “Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts.”<br/><span style="float: right;"><sup>Heb 4:6‭-‬7 NIV</sup></span></i></p>
				</div>

				<p>There remaains an appointed rest for God's people Continued meditation on the character of Issachar and his burdens brought to me a new understanding of God's appointed rest for His people, that though the rest remains and <b>has been promised to us</b>, we have a part to play in coming into that rest, on our part there <b>most</b> be an understanding of this resting and wisdom to trust God according to His word to enter into His rest.
				
				<p><b>Land that it was pleasant</b>; I was reminded of the attitude of every sane farmer that finds a good land to cultivate his crops; when he is admiring the land and the increase it <b>could</b> give him, he understands that this increase only comes by putting his hands to <b>working the earth</b>.</p>
